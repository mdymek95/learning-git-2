(Learn— their lives again) It's Friday again (Their lives— to pull us) Then Saturday, Sunday, what? (Learn— their lives again) It's Friday (Their lives— to pull us) Then Saturday, Sunday It's Friday again It's Saturday, Sunday, what? It's Friday again, -gain, -ain, -ain [Verse 1] I thought the hands of time would change me And I'd be over this by now, yeah It's been too long since we got crazy I'm lowkey spinnin' out [Pre-Chorus] I'm countin' down 'til Friday come I'm gonna, I'm gonna do too much Know I'm all in my bag, that's clutch Feelin' it, feelin' it, feelin' it Every Friday, Saturday, Sunday Endless weekend, on a wave, yeah [Chorus] It's Friday again It's Saturday, Sunday, what? It's Friday again It's Saturday, Sunday, what? (We want that weekend) It's Friday again (Oh) It's Saturday, Sunday, what? (We want that weekend) It's Friday again It's Saturday, Sunday, what?
