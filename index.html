        <p>[Intro]
            <br>
            Mufasa
            <br>
            Hmm?
            <br>
            You know we finally here, right?
            <br>
            Where are we?
            <br>
            It's Friday then
            <br>
            Then Saturday, Sunday, what?
            <br>
            (Learn— their lives again) It's Friday again
            <br>
            (Their lives— to pull us) Then Saturday, Sunday, what?
            <br>
            (Learn— their lives again) It's Friday 
            <br>
            (Their lives— to pull us) Then Saturday, Sunday
            <br>
            It's Friday again
            <br>
            It's Saturday, Sunday, what?
            <br>
            It's Friday again, -gain, -ain, -ain
        </p>
        <p>[Verse 1]
            <br>
            I thought the hands of time would change me
            <br>
            And I'd be over this by now, yeah
            <br>
            It's been too long since we got crazy
            <br>
            I'm lowkey spinnin' out
        </p>
